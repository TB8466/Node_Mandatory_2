# Node_Mandatory_2

Login fully encrypts and authenticates password. Yet login still has no purpose since sessions aren't up and running.

app.js runs on port 3000, while Svelte runs on 8080.
Run both at the same time and display on http://localhost:3000

Database used is mySQL. Use the mySQL script in the root of the project, or feel free to add your own stuff on the admin tap.

emailHandler.js can be run from the backend, although it will only send to other ethereal mails (which is why it itsn't implemented).
